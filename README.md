# Calculator_Website
A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features a clean interface for basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide). HTML structures the layout with buttons for digits, operations, and a display. CSS provides a modern design with a responsive grid. JavaScript manages the logic, updating the display and performing calculation.
